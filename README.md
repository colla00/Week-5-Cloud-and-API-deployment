# Week 5: Cloud and API deployment
https://week-5-api-d67af3a8cb26.herokuapp.com/
Welcome to Week 5's Cloud and API Deployment, an application designed as a Pima Indians Diabetes Predictor. This project is hosted on Heroku, allowing seamless access to its features. To deploy this app on Heroku, clone the repository, create a new Heroku app, and push your code to the Heroku remote. The app dataset is a collection of medical data relating to diabetes among the Pima Native American tribe. The dataset contains various health-related attributes along with a target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes. The goal typically associated with this dataset is to build a predictive model that can use the available health attributes to predict whether an individual has diabetes or not. This task involves training machine learning algorithms on a subset of the data to learn patterns and relationships between the attributes and the diabetes outcome. Refer to the sections above for detailed instructions on usage, deployment, and API documentation.
